Moin Moin!
I have written this software for a quick and easy data visualization, since I could no longer watch people and me using Excel for this. I use Python only since 2015. I think there is still a lot that could be significantly improved.

Preinstall Python 3 with the common packages and PyQt5 as GUI.
I prefer the Python Distribution Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
PyQt5 (https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)

Have fun!
